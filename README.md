## README

It is a program that I have developed independently. It can extract [annual top 250 movie rankings](https://movie.douban.com/top250?start=0&filter=) from [Chinese movie review site](https://www.douban.com). With just a single click, the program can extract data at runtime and save it in both Excel and SQLite formats, making it easy for users to analyze and manipulate the data according to their needs. 

The program utilizes **Python**,and **SQLite database management system** to automate the data extraction process.

## How to run douban.py

**The program can be run directly after cloning to local (early 2021)** After a complete run, it will automatically generate an [Excel file](https://github.com/han-ziqi/douban/blob/master/豆瓣电影Top250.xls) containing the results, as well as a [SQLite. db file](https://github.com/han-ziqi/douban/blob/master/movie.db)
